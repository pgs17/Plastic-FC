## Yolov8 Object Detection Project 

A Computer Vision project that allows you to detect Plastic from the river after taking images from drone and gives you the location of plastic for removal purpose and minimising water pollution

## Theme

Computer Vision and Object Detection 

## Problem Statement
  Develop a reliable and efficient AI-based object detection model using drone images to detect plastic waste in rivers and demonstrate a feasible solution/system architecture for implementation, ultimately reducing the negative impact of plastic pollution on the environment and human health.
 

## Objective


This project aims to:

- detect plastic waste in rivers and help in reducing water pollution
- to give the location of river where plastic is present and also latitude and longitude of plastic

## Proposed Solution

This project covers all aspects that need to be emphasised on to minimise the problem:
- plastic is detected
- location of river is given
- latitude and longitude of plastic is given

## Proposed TechStack

<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Yolov8(for model training refer:ultralytics)</li>
<li>Cvat(For annotation purpose)</li>
</ul>
